# `P20303` - LEGO sets

Write a program that reads LEGO sets from the standard input, then prints them to the standard output.

## The input

The standard input contains data of lego sets. A lego set has four properties:

* number of the set (string)
* name of the set (string)
* theme of the set (string)
* pieces in the set (integer)

Each line represents a single lego set in the following format:

```
<code>;<name>;<theme>;<pieces>
```

## The output

The program should print each lego set to the standard output (in the original order), in the following format:

```
<name> (<code>): <pieces> - <theme>
```

## Examples

### Standard input

1.  The end of the input is denoted with `EOF`. It is guaranteed, that the standard input contains at most `20` lines.

    ```
    30356;Hot dog stand;Lego City;43
    30360;Arctic Ice Saw;Lego City;43
    30381;Imperial TIE Fighter;Lego Star Wars;42
    10258;London Bus;Lego Creator Expert;1686
    10253;Big Ben;Lego Creator Expert;4163
    ```

1.  The end of the input is denoted with a line containing character sequence `"END"`. It is guaranteed, that the standard input contains at most `20` lines. The last line should not be processed.

    ```
    30356;Hot dog stand;Lego City;43
    30360;Arctic Ice Saw;Lego City;43
    30381;Imperial TIE Fighter;Lego Star Wars;42
    10258;London Bus;Lego Creator Expert;1686
    10253;Big Ben;Lego Creator Expert;4163
    END
    ```

1.  The first line of the input contains value `n` denoting the number of lego sets. Each of the next `n` lines describes a lego set. It is guaranteed, that the standard input contains at most `20` lines. The empty line should not be processed.

    ```
