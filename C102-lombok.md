# `C102` - Project Lombok

## Highlights

### Adding the dependency

Add the following element to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok -->
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
   <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
   <version>1.18.34</version>
   <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Annotation `@NonNull` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/NonNull))

You can use `@NonNull` on a record component, or a parameter of a method or constructor. This will cause to lombok generate a null-check statement for you.

#### Places

1. method parameter
1. constructor parameter

#### Configuration

not required for you

### Annotation `@Cleanup` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/Cleanup))

You can use `@Cleanup` to ensure a given resource is automatically cleaned up before the code execution path exits your current scope.

#### Place

resource declaration

#### Configuration

not required for you

### Annotation `@Getter/@Setter` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter))

You can annotate any field with `@Getter` and/or `@Setter`, to let lombok generate the default getter/setter automatically. You can also put a `@Getter` and/or `@Setter` annotation on a class. In that case, it's as if you annotate all the non-static fields in that class with the annotation.

#### Places

1. class
1. field

#### Configuration

1. parameter `value`: the visibility modifier
   1. value `AccessLevel.PUBLIC`: public visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PROTECTED`: protected visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PACKAGE`: package visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PRIVATE`: private visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.NONE`: disable the generation

### Annotation `@ToString` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/ToString))

Annotating a class with `@ToString` will cause lombok to generate an implementation of the `toString()` method. You use configuration options to specify whether field names should be included but otherwise the format is fixed: the class name followed by parentheses containing fields separated by commas, e.g. `MyClass(foo=123, bar=234)`.

#### Place

class

#### Configuration

1. parameter `onlyExplicitlyIncluded`: how the fields will be used
   1. value `false`: you must annotate all the excluded fields with `@ToString.Exclude` (**default**)
   1. value `true`: you must annotate all the included fields with `@ToString.Include` 

Methods can be also added to the generation by annotating them with `@ToString.Include`.

### Annotation `@EqualsAndHashCode` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/EqualsAndHashCode))

Any class definition may be annotated with `@EqualsAndHashCode` to let lombok generate implementations of the `equals(Object other)` and `hashCode()` methods. By default, it'll use all non-static, non-transient fields, but you can modify which fields are used (and even specify that the output of various methods is to be used) by marking type members with `@EqualsAndHashCode.Include` or `@EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude`. Alternatively, you can specify exactly which fields or methods you wish to be used by marking them with `@EqualsAndHashCode.Include` and using `@EqualsAndHashCode(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)`.

#### Place

class

#### Configuration

parameter `onlyExplicitlyIncluded`: how the fields will be used

1. value `false`: you must annotate all the excluded fields with `@EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude` (**default**)
1. value `true`: you must annotate all the included fields with `@EqualsAndHashCode.Include` 

### Annotation `@NoArgsConstructor` / `@RequiredArgsConstructor` / `@AllArgsConstrutor` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor))


This set of `3` annotations generate a constructor that will accept 1 parameter for certain fields, and simply assigns this parameter to the field.

`@NoArgsConstructor` will generate a constructor with no parameters. If this is not possible (because of final fields), a compiler error will result instead, unless `@NoArgsConstructor(force = true)` is used, then all final fields are initialized with `0` / `false` / `null`. For fields with constraints, such as `@NonNull` fields, no check is generated,so be aware that these constraints will generally not be fulfilled until those fields are properly initialized later. Certain java constructs, such as hibernate and the Service Provider Interface require a no-args constructor. This annotation is useful primarily in combination with either `@Data` or one of the other constructor generating annotations.

`@RequiredArgsConstructor` generates a constructor with 1 parameter for each field that requires special handling. All non-initialized final fields get a parameter, as well as any fields that are marked as `@NonNull` that aren't initialized where they are declared. For those fields marked with `@NonNull`, an explicit null check is also generated. The constructor will throw a NullPointerException if any of the parameters intended for the fields marked with `@NonNull` contain `null`. The order of the parameters match the order in which the fields appear in your class.

`@AllArgsConstructor` generates a constructor with 1 parameter for each field in your class. Fields marked with `@NonNull `result in `null` checks on those parameters.

#### Place

class

#### Configuration

1. parameter `access`: the visibility modifier
   1. value `AccessLevel.PUBLIC`: public visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PROTECTED`: protected visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PACKAGE`: package visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.PRIVATE`: private visibility
   1. value `AccessLevel.NONE`: disable the generation
1. parameter `force`: whether generate a dummy assignment for each `final` field (default: `false`)

   Required for the `@NoArgsConstructor` when using the `@Value` annotation to make the class immutable.

### Annotation `@SneakyThrows` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows))

`@SneakyThrows` can be used to sneakily throw checked exceptions without actually declaring this in your method's throws clause. This somewhat contentious ability should be used carefully, of course. The code generated by lombok will not ignore, wrap, replace, or otherwise modify the thrown checked exception; it simply fakes out the compiler. On the JVM (class file) level, all exceptions, checked or not, can be thrown regardless of the `throws` clause of your methods, which is why this works.

#### Place

method

#### Configuration

not required for you

### Annotation `@Data` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data))

A shortcut for `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@Getter` on all fields,` @Setter` on all non-final fields, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`.

#### Place

class

#### Configuration

not acceptible (use the previous annotations individually to change the behavior)

### Annotation `@Value` ([Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/Value))

`@Value` is the immutable variant of `@Data`; all fields are made private and final by default, and setters are not generated. The class itself is also made `final` by default, because immutability is not something that can be forced onto a subclass. Like `@Data`, useful `toString()`, `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are also generated, each field gets a getter method, and a constructor that covers every argument (except final fields that are initialized in the field declaration) is also generated.

#### Place

class

#### Configuration

not acceptible (use the previous annotations individually to change the behavior)
